#Distance Traveled
#Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
#Distance= Speed x Time
#A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
#The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
#The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
#The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

#Set speed constant
speed = 70

#New time 6 hours
distance = speed * 6
print('The distance is', distance, 'miles')

#new time 10 hours
distance = speed * 10
print('The distance is', distance, 'miles')

#new time 15 hours
distance = speed * 15
print('The distance is', distance, 'miles')
