# File: <Falling Distance>
# Description: <Write a function named falling_distance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds)
# as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has
# fallen during that time interval. Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes
# the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.>
